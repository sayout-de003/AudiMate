# AuditEase: Product Overview

## Product Vision
To turn "Compliance" from a manual spreadsheet nightmare into an automated, "Big 4" quality engineering standard.

## Problem Statement
CTOs and Devs spend weeks taking screenshots for auditors. Existing tools (Vanta) are expensive and top-down. Devs need a bottom-up, engineering-first tool.

## Target Customers
*   **CTOs/VPs**: Need the "Executive PDF" to show investors.
*   **DevOps Engineers**: Need the "Gatekeeper" to block bad code.
*   **Auditors**: Need the "Immutable Artifact" (Evidence).

## Key Features
1.  **The Executive Report**: Auto-generated PDF with weighted scoring (A-F).
2.  **The Gatekeeper**: GitHub Action that blocks insecure PRs.
3.  **Evidence Locker**: Immutable history of all scans.

## Competitors
*   **Vanta/Drata**: We are cheaper, dev-focused.
*   **SonarQube**: We focus on compliance metadata, not just code quality.
